# Date_Library

This project demonstrates the creation data types, `Date`, in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Overview

The `Library-Char-String` project focuses on implementing two fundamental data types to handle date with custom functionality. The primary objective is to showcase the application of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.

## Data Types

### Date

The `Char` class represents a single character. It provides methods to set, get, and manipulate the character value.


## Features

- Encapsulation of character and string functionalities
- Custom methods for character and string manipulation
- Support for dynamic memory management
- Illustration of OOP principles in C++

## Getting Started

To get started with the `Date_Library` project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository from the source.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
4. Run the provided sample applications to test the `Date` class.
